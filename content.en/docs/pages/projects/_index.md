# Projects

I have made a few websites for fun.

# DONK.WORLD

A silly site for a music collective my friends run.

Try and find all the easter eggs.

# RECOMMEND

A movie recommender that uses the OpenAI API to recommend movies.

A bit of prompt engineering, a bit of parsing responses, took a few hours, bit of fun.

# REAL FAKE NEWS SPACE

Ran a local copy of GPT3, scraped RSS feeds for titles, and generated gibberish articles from the titles. It's Real, it's fake, its the real fake news space.

Script to generate the articles was just a Python script, hasnt been ran in a while but this was made before ChatGPT, so it felt like I was coding SkyNet...

# GLEN CLANCEY

This was a serious website, but he stopped practising art, so i made this abomoniation

# Wedding websites
## GLEN AND TEESH

A wedding website for friends

https://gnt.pooper.net.au

Wordpress (yuck). Still styled it almost completely away from the theme. Needed Wordpress for some RSVP form, found out better ways to do it but this worked for what it needed to.

## GIGI AND DAN

A wedding website for family

https://gd.pooper.net.au


## GRACE AND ALEX

A wedding website for some family

https://gna.pooper.net.au/

Just a static site, fairly simple, used a few libraries/codepens and CTRL+C --> CTRL+V to get some effects I had no business coding myself.
