# Plex Audiobook setup

This guide will explain through the steps required to listen to audiobooks on plex.

I have created an exclusive audibook library, Plex apps do not play long form audio very well at all, some community members have made a few native phone applications that provide a top class audiobook and podcast listening experience. 

This guide will have steps showing the setup process across both platforms (Android, iOS).

# Pre-requisites

1. You must be invited to the Audiobook library by me first
2. Download the appropriate application for your device.
